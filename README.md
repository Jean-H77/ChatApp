# COMP 429 Chat App

In order to run the application, you must first create a jar file of the code. Using IntelliJ, you can run a gradle task to create the jar file. Once it is created, make sure to run the .jar file in the terminal and also putting a parameter for the port number. The default port number is set to 5001 if there is no port number given by the user. If you would like to run the process in an IDE of your choice, the source code is also inside the zipped file. Make sure to assign each process that you decide to run their own port number, or else the application will not work. The command to run the .jar file in terminal is:

java -jar ChatApp.jar

  - Worked on step 6 allowing user to terminate connections and removing them from the lists
  - Fixed a few issues on step 5 where the list command provided wrong ports
